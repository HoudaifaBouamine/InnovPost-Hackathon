# Package Delivery System  

A comprehensive and secure package delivery system developed during a hackathon to revolutionize Algérie Poste's logistics platform. The system focuses on improving customer trust, enhancing security, and ensuring a seamless package tracking experience.  

## Features  

### 1. Secure User Registration  
- All users (senders and receivers) are required to create verified accounts through Algérie Poste’s **ECCP account** system (website).  
- This ensures secure and authenticated access to the platform.  

### 2. Secure Tracking Number Access  
- Only registered and authorized users can view package details.  
- Enhanced data privacy ensures that package details remain confidential and accessible only to the intended recipients.  

### 3. Efficient Tracking Number Distribution  
- When the sender initiates a shipment, the tracking number is automatically:  
  - Shared with the sender’s account.  
  - Shared with the receiver’s account.  
- Notifications are seamlessly delivered via the platform, ensuring streamlined communication and reducing dependency on manual sharing.  

### 4. Self-Sufficient Ecosystem  
- The system eliminates reliance on third-party platforms like AliExpress for package tracking.  
- By building a proprietary platform, Algérie Poste:  
  - Strengthens its position as a competitive and independent logistics provider.  
  - Enhances customer trust and satisfaction.
